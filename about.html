            HELP FOUNDATION, is a registered charity that was established 4 years ago by Ms.Medha Patil and Ms.Insha Fathima. It was set up in order to tackle the problems of poverty in Bengaluru, especially amongst young children. From its humble origins as a family institution it has grown rapidly, and now its projects cover a wide range of activities located in both India and other developing countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, Kenya and Burundi. HELP FOUNDATION is committed to the welfare of people from the most underprivileged strata of society without distinction of caste, creed or color. Its emphasis is on assisting the children and youth who are the citizens of tomorrow and the disabled who need a support to help them join mainstream society. Our logo symbolises our togetherness for the future â€“ a future in which each and every human can look forward to a new day, a day free of hunger, suffering, abuse and poverty. We want to reach out to children across the world, to give them new opportunities, and help them rise out of poverty.
